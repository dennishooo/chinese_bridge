# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Chinese Bridge (標分) is a complex trick-taking card game for four players that requires a sophisticated digital implementation. The system will provide a complete online gaming platform with real-time multiplayer functionality, user authentication via Google OAuth, and a scalable microservices architecture deployed on Kubernetes. The platform will faithfully implement the traditional Chinese Bridge rules while providing modern features like matchmaking, game history, and responsive cross-platform gameplay.
